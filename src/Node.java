 * This code is supposed to represent a huffman algorithm that takes in an input 
 * file and counts the frequency of each letter, encodes the characters by their frequency
 * with their own binary code into a binary tree and prints the encoded message to an output file.
 *
 * Attempted to print code for each character but was only able to get the character w to print for each code
 * Because of this, attemps to encode and decode weren't successful
